						Though very sturdy, it’s easily transportable and is assembled with just five Allen screws (easy-to-follow instructions are included or contact our customer service team). It can take canvases up to 127cm (50”) which is over A0.
						It weighs 6.7kg (14.9lb) and can easily be folded flat. </td>
